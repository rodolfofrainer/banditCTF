# banditCTF

This is a sort of a progress diary towards the "Flag" on the [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) website.

## How the progress documentation works

**I intend to document the progress in the following order:**

### 1. The problem

The problem proposed by the overthewire team.

### 2. Logging into the terminal

Every level has a different credential, in every level the user selects the level he wants to log into using for example the user bandit0 (level 0), bandit1(level 1), etc.

## 3. Overview

A general overview of how to proceed in with the problem, a list of the files or perhaps a general idea of how the thought process used to solve the problem.

### 4. The command/commands used to solve the problem

Which commands are used to fix the problem, as well as an explanation on how to use them in that scenario

### 5. Putting it all together

Finally solving the scenario and getting the credentials towards the next one.
